# Connect Four


## Summary

A "Connect Four" game in a classic 6 x 7 board or grid, built using JS, HTML table, a little bit of CSS, and a mixture of Luck. :)

## Specs

* Either player should be able to win by making 4 in a row in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal (either direction) pattern.

* The winner should be immediately announced once there is one, and no moves can be taken after.

* It should be possible to reach a draw state. A draw state is when there is no possible move left for either player and there is no winner.

* It should not falsely and/or prematurely declare a player as a winner or a draw.
